# MuleSoft Application

This application has made by YouTube tutorial "Getting Started with MuleSoft". The goal is understanding of MuleSoft technology. I created my first project, deployed it to MuleSoft cloud using Anypoint platform and Anypoint Studio. Were created some security files ("local" and "dev"), added log-component on canvas with code that output password and username. Using secure-properties-tool.jar were encrypted passwords and usernames. Added new API using API Manager in the cloud, added to Anypoint Studio my ClientID and Client Secret.
